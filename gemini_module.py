    Example 1:
    - X-axis: Temperature Front (Â°C)
    - Y-axis: Power TEG (W)
    - Analysis: The data shows a strong positive correlation between Temperature Front and Power TEG. As the temperature increases, the power output from the TEG also increases. This suggests that the TEG is more efficient at higher temperatures.

    Example 2:
    - X-axis: Voltage Solar (V)
    - Y-axis: Current Solar (A)
    - Analysis: The data exhibits a linear relationship between Voltage Solar and Current Solar. As the voltage increases, the current also increases proportionally. This indicates that the solar panel is operating within its expected range.
